# Adjustable Manipulator Design  

## Task Description  
The goal of this project was to design a mechanical setup for the manual adjustment of micromechanical devices. The system was required to:  

- Enable tip movement of **±10 mm in the x-direction** and **±5 mm in the z-direction**.  
- Provide **play-free displacement** with a resolution of **10 µm** in both directions.  
- Fit within a maximum footprint of **70 mm × 40 mm**.  
- Position a **0.65 mm probe tip** at a distance of **100 mm** from the adjusting unit, **10 mm below the bottom plate**, at an angle of **45°**.  

## Deliverables  
- Systematic development of the manipulator including sketches, schematic diagrams, dimensioning, and mathematical verification.  
- 3D CAD models of all required components and assemblies in Autodesk Inventor, considering manufacturability.  
- Material selection for each component.  
- Technical drawings of all components and assemblies (compiled as a PDF).  
- A written project report.
